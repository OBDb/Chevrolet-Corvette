## Generations

The Chevrolet Corvette has gone through eight distinct generations since its introduction:

- **C1 (1953-1962)**: The first generation Corvette started as a show car and evolved into America's first true sports car. Initially equipped with an inline-six engine and later with V8 options, the C1 established the Corvette nameplate with its distinctive fiberglass body and roadster design.

- **C2 (1963-1967)**: Known as the "Sting Ray," this generation introduced the iconic split rear window design (1963 only) and hidden headlamps. The C2 offered more powerful engine options, including the legendary 427 cubic inch big-block V8, and established the Corvette as a serious performance car.

- **C3 (1968-1982)**: The longest-running Corvette generation featured the recognizable "Coke bottle" styling inspired by the Mako Shark II concept. Despite facing challenges during the oil crisis and emissions regulations, the C3 maintained the Corvette's performance heritage while adapting to changing market conditions.

- **C4 (1984-1996)**: A complete redesign brought modern technology and aerodynamics to the Corvette. This generation introduced digital instrumentation, improved handling through a completely redesigned chassis, and later featured the high-performance ZR-1 variant with its DOHC LT5 engine.

- **C5 (1997-2004)**: The fifth generation represented another technological leap with its hydroformed perimeter frame, rear-mounted transmission for improved weight distribution, and the powerful LS1 V8 engine. The C5 significantly improved performance, comfort, and efficiency over its predecessors.

- **C6 (2005-2013)**: Building on the C5's successful architecture, the C6 featured exposed headlights for the first time since 1962, a more refined interior, and enhanced performance. The Z06 and later ZR1 models pushed the performance envelope with specialized powertrains and chassis components.

- **C7 (2014-2019)**: The final front-engine Corvette brought aggressive styling and advanced technologies like direct injection and cylinder deactivation to the platform. The C7 generation included the track-focused Z06 and the ultimate front-engine Corvette, the 755-horsepower ZR1.

- **C8 (2020-present)**: A revolutionary departure from tradition, the eighth generation features a mid-engine layout for the first time in production Corvette history. The C8 offers supercar performance with a mid-mounted LT2 V8 engine, significantly improved handling dynamics, and exotic car styling while maintaining relative affordability compared to its European competitors.
