generations:
  - name: "First Generation (C1)"
    start_year: 1953
    end_year: 1962
    description: "The original Corvette, codenamed C1, debuted in 1953 as a concept car at GM's Motorama show and quickly entered limited production. Initially available only in Polo White with a red interior, the first-year models featured a revolutionary fiberglass body—a material choice made to bypass steel shortages following World War II that would become a Corvette hallmark. Contrary to its later reputation, the C1 began life as more of a cruiser than a sports car, powered by a lackluster 150-horsepower 'Blue Flame' inline-six engine paired with a two-speed automatic transmission. Sales struggled until 1955, when Chief Engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov—who would become known as the 'Father of the Corvette'—convinced GM to install a small-block V8, transforming the car's character and trajectory. The 1956 model brought a comprehensive redesign with proper roll-up windows and optional removable hardtop. The 1957 model year introduced fuel injection, making Corvette one of the first mass-produced cars with this technology. By 1962, the final year of C1 production, the Corvette had evolved significantly, with power reaching up to 360 horsepower from the fuel-injected 327 cubic-inch V8. The first-generation Corvette established the nameplate's identity as America's sports car and laid the foundation for its future performance legacy."

  - name: "Second Generation (C2)"
    start_year: 1963
    end_year: 1967
    description: "The second-generation Corvette, known as the 'Sting Ray' (written as two words until 1969), revolutionized the model with its dramatic styling and advanced engineering. Designed by Bill Mitchell and Larry Shinoda, the C2 featured distinctive split-window styling on the 1963 coupe—a controversial one-year-only design element now highly prized by collectors. For the first time, Corvette offered both convertible and coupe body styles. The C2 rode on a completely new chassis with independent rear suspension—a radical departure from the live axle of the C1—significantly improving handling and ride quality. Power came from variations of Chevrolet's small-block V8, initially displacing 327 cubic inches with outputs ranging from 250 to 360 horsepower. In 1965, a big-block V8 option was introduced, first as a 396 cubic-inch unit and later as a 427, producing up to 435 horsepower in its highest state of tune. The legendary L88 427 engine, conservatively rated at 430 horsepower but actually producing closer to 500, debuted in 1967 as a limited-production racing-oriented option. Four-wheel disc brakes became standard in 1965, further enhancing the Corvette's performance credentials. Though produced for just five model years, the C2 Corvette has become one of the most iconic and collectible American cars, representing the perfect balance of style, performance, and innovation that defined the model's golden age."

  - name: "Third Generation (C3)"
    start_year: 1968
    end_year: 1982
    description: "The third-generation Corvette, introduced in 1968, featured radical 'Mako Shark II' styling by Larry Shinoda under Bill Mitchell's design leadership. While maintaining the previous generation's chassis architecture, the C3 looked entirely different with its pronounced fender flares, long hood, and tapered rear deck. Initially offered with an array of high-performance engine options including the formidable 427 and later 454 cubic-inch big blocks, the C3 suffered from power decreases throughout its run due to tightening emissions regulations and the energy crisis. By 1975, the legendary big-block V8s had disappeared from the lineup, and the base L48 small-block output had fallen to 165 horsepower. Despite this, the C3 remained popular, with Chevrolet selling over 58,000 units in 1979—the highest annual Corvette sales up to that point. Notable developments during the extended C3 production run included the introduction of T-tops in 1968, a body-colored urethane front bumper in 1973, and a redesigned fastback rear window in 1978 with the Silver Anniversary and Pace Car editions. While the later C3 models lacked the raw power of their early counterparts, they gained improvements in build quality, refinement, and technology. The 1982 Collector Edition marked the end of the C3 era with special features including a lifting glass hatch—the first on a Corvette since 1967—and the Cross-Fire Injection fuel system that previewed the technology of the upcoming C4 generation."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (C4)"
    start_year: 1984
    end_year: 1996
    description: "The fourth-generation Corvette represented a complete reinvention of America's sports car after 15 years of C3 production. There was no 1983 model year Corvette, as development delays pushed the C4's introduction to 1984. The new design featured a sleek, modern shape with a clamshell hood, hideaway headlights, and a glass hatchback. The C4 introduced an entirely new chassis with a uniframe design, forged aluminum suspension components, and a digital dashboard that epitomized 1980s high-tech aesthetics. Initially powered by the 'Cross-Fire' injection 350 V8 producing 205 horsepower, the C4 quickly evolved with the introduction of Tuned Port Injection in 1985, boosting output to 230 horsepower. Performance continued to improve throughout the generation, highlighted by the introduction of the Corvette ZR-1 in 1990. Developed in collaboration with Lotus Engineering and powered by the hand-built LT5 DOHC V8 producing 375 horsepower, the ZR-1 could achieve 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds and a top speed of 180 mph—exotic car territory for the era. The standard Corvette received its own power boost with the LT1 engine in 1992, producing 300 horsepower. The C4's final year brought the Grand Sport special edition, featuring Admiral Blue paint with a white stripe and black wheels, plus the Collector Edition. While initial C4 models emphasized handling over straight-line speed, by the end of its run, the fourth-generation Corvette had evolved into a well-rounded performance car that successfully rehabilitated the nameplate's performance image after the emissions-strangled late C3 models."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (C5)"
    start_year: 1997
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The fifth-generation Corvette debuted for 1997, introducing revolutionary changes to the model's architecture and construction. Chief Engineer Dave Hill focused on addressing the C4's shortcomings with a completely new platform featuring a hydroformed perimeter frame, a rear-mounted transmission for improved weight distribution (transaxle design), and a more rigid structure with a backbone design that reduced weight while increasing torsional stiffness by four times compared to the C4. Power came from the new LS1 all-aluminum 5.7-liter V8, producing 345 horsepower at launch and later increased to 350 horsepower. The C5 was available in three body styles: coupe with a removable roof panel, convertible, and the fixed-roof hardtop introduced in 1999, which became the basis for the track-focused Z06 model in 2001. The Z06 featured the uprated LS6 engine, initially producing 385 horsepower and later 405 horsepower, along with a titanium exhaust, lighter glass, and suspension tuned for maximum performance. The Z06 could accelerate from 0-60 mph in under 4 seconds and achieve nearly 1g of lateral grip on the skidpad. Beyond its performance capabilities, the C5 was more practical than previous Corvettes, with a real trunk in the coupe and improved ergonomics. The interior featured dual cockpit styling reminiscent of earlier generations but with modern amenities and improved build quality. The C5 represented a quantum leap forward for the Corvette, earning widespread acclaim for successfully combining world-class performance with everyday usability at a fraction of the price of exotic European competitors."

  - name: "Sixth Generation (C6)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The sixth-generation Corvette, introduced for 2005, represented an evolutionary approach to the revolutionary C5 platform. The C6 maintained the same basic architecture as its predecessor while addressing many of its weaknesses. Most noticeably, the C6 eliminated the pop-up headlights that had been a Corvette signature since 1963, replacing them with fixed xenon HID projector units that improved aerodynamics and lighting performance. The exterior dimensions shrunk slightly compared to the C5, but interior space increased through more efficient packaging. Power initially came from a new LS2 6.0-liter V8 producing 400 horsepower, replaced in 2008 by the LS3 6.2-liter V8 with 430 horsepower. The Z06 model returned for 2006, now powered by the 7.0-liter LS7 V8—the largest small-block ever produced—hand-built with racing-derived features like titanium connecting rods and delivering 505 horsepower. The C6 generation reached its performance apex with the introduction of the ZR1 in 2009, featuring a supercharged 6.2-liter LS9 V8 producing 638 horsepower, extensive carbon fiber bodywork, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, and Magnetic Selective Ride Control suspension. With a top speed exceeding 200 mph, the ZR1 was the fastest, most powerful, and most expensive production Corvette to date. The C6 generation also saw the introduction of the Grand Sport model in 2010, combining the standard powertrain with many of the Z06's handling and visual elements. Interior quality, a longtime Corvette criticism, saw improvements throughout the generation, particularly with the 2008 refresh. The C6 Corvette further expanded the model's global credibility with multiple class victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in GT1 competition."

  - name: "Seventh Generation (C7)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The seventh-generation Corvette debuted for 2014 with the revival of the Stingray name (now as a single word) and a bold new design language featuring angular lines, aggressive vents, and a more European-inspired appearance. While still using an evolved version of the front-engine, rear-transaxle architecture introduced with the C5, the C7 was almost entirely new, with just two parts carried over from the C6. The aluminum frame, previously reserved for Z06 and ZR1 models, became standard across the lineup, contributing to a 50:50 weight distribution. Inside, the C7 addressed longstanding criticism with a dramatically improved interior featuring quality materials, a driver-focused cockpit with high-resolution displays, and genuine carbon fiber and aluminum trim. Power came from the new LT1 6.2-liter direct-injected V8 with 455 horsepower (460 with the optional performance exhaust), utilizing Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation technology to improve efficiency. The Z06 model returned for 2015, now featuring a supercharged LT4 V8 producing 650 horsepower, matching performance levels previously reserved for the C6 ZR1, accompanied by an aggressive aerodynamic package available in three increasingly track-focused levels. For 2019, the final year of C7 production, Chevrolet introduced the ZR1 with the 755-horsepower supercharged LT5 V8, massive cooling upgrades, and an optional High Wing package generating 950 pounds of downforce. The C7 generation also introduced the Grand Sport model that combined the Z06's wider body and suspension tuning with the base Stingray's naturally aspirated engine. Performance technology included available Magnetic Ride Control suspension, an electronic limited-slip differential, Performance Traction Management system, and a rev-matching feature for manual transmissions. The C7 represented the pinnacle of front-engine Corvette development, delivering supercar performance while maintaining the practicality and value proposition that had long defined the model."

  - name: "Eighth Generation (C8)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The eighth-generation Corvette, introduced for the 2020 model year, represents the most radical reinvention in the model's history with its adoption of a mid-engine layout—fulfilling a vision Zora Arkus-Duntov had pursued since the 1960s. This fundamental architecture change positions the 6.2-liter LT2 V8 engine behind the passenger compartment but ahead of the rear axle, enabling superior weight distribution, improved traction, and a more direct connection between driver inputs and vehicle response. Even in base Stingray form, the C8 produces 495 horsepower with the Z51 performance package, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration in under 3 seconds—performance that required the top-tier ZR1 in the previous generation. The exterior design embodies the mid-engine proportions with a short, low hood, large side air intakes, and a cab-forward stance, while still incorporating traditional Corvette design cues. The interior features a driver-centric cockpit with a squared-off steering wheel, digital instrument cluster, and a distinctive row of climate controls separating driver and passenger. Technological advancements include a GPS-based front-lift system that remembers locations where additional ground clearance is needed, a digital rearview mirror, and advanced customization of performance parameters. The Z06 variant, introduced for 2023, elevates the C8's performance with the naturally aspirated 5.5-liter flat-plane crank LT6 V8 producing 670 horsepower and revving to 8,600 rpm—the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 ever in a production car. With a significantly wider body, advanced aerodynamics generating 734 pounds of downforce, and available carbon fiber wheels, the Z06 delivers track capabilities that rival dedicated racing cars. The 2024 model year introduced the hybrid all-wheel-drive E-Ray, combining the LT2 V8 with an electric motor on the front axle to produce a combined 655 horsepower. The 2024 ZR1, powered by a twin-turbocharged version of the Z06's LT6 engine, codenamed LT7, is expected to produce over 800 horsepower. The mid-engine C8 has successfully transformed the Corvette into a legitimate exotic car competitor while maintaining relative affordability compared to its European rivals."
